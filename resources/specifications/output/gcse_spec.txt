1.1 Why choose AQA for GCSE  Physics
Our philosophy: science for all
We believe that science has something to offer every student. That's why we have a suite of
science qualifications for Key Stage 4 – to suit students of all abilities and all aspirations.
You'll see that our GCSE Physics, along with Chemistry and Biology, is a clear straightforward
specification, with clear straightforward exams, so all your students can realise their potential.
Our specification  has been developed with teachers
We’ve involved over a thousand teachers in developing our specification, exams and resources.
So you can be confident that our GCSE Physics is relevant and interesting to teach and to learn.
We’ve ensured that:
• the subject content is presented clearly, in a logical teaching order. We’ve also given
teaching guidance and signposted opportunities for skills development throughout the
specification.
• the subject content and required practicals in our GCSE Combined Science: Trilogy are also
in our GCSE Biology, Chemistry and Physics. So you have the flexibility to co-teach or to
move your students between courses.
• all our science qualifications provide opportunities for progression. Our GCSE Physics
includes progression in the subject content and consistency in the exam questions, so that
your students have the best preparation for A-level.
Our practicals have been trialled by teachers
There’s no better way to learn about science than through purposeful practical activities as part of
day to day teaching and learning. Our eight required practicals:
• are clearly laid out in the specification, so you know exactly what’s required
• are deliberately open, so you can teach in the way that suits you and your students
• have already been trialled in schools.
You’ll find even more support and guidance in our practical handbook, which includes
recommendations and advice from teachers in the trial.
Straightforward exams, so students can give straightforward answers
We’ve improved our question papers. You’ll find that our exams:
• use more straightforward language and fewer words so they’re easier to understand
• have fewer contexts so students don’t get confused
• have questions that increase in difficulty so students feel confident
• have been written with our GCSE Maths and A-level science teams, so students have
consistency between content and questions.AQA GCSE Physics 8463. GCSE exams June 2018 onwards. Version 1.1 30 September 2019

Science is a set of ideas about the material world. We have included all the parts of what good
science is at GCSE level: whether it be investigating, observing, experimenting or testing out ideas
and thinking about them. The way scientific ideas flow through the specification will support you in
building a deep understanding of science with your students. We know this will involve talking
about, reading and writing about science plus the actual doing, as well as representing science in
its many forms both mathematically and visually through models.
This specification encourages the development of knowledge and understanding in science
through opportunities for working scientifically. Working scientifically is the sum of all the activities
that scientists do. We feel it is so important that we have woven it throughout our specification and
written papers.
Our schemes of work will take this further for you and signpost a range of ways to navigate through
this qualification so your students are engaged and enthused. These free resources support the
use of mathematics as a tool for thinking through the use of mathematical language in
explanations, applications and evaluations.
The tables below show examples of the ways working scientifically could be assessed.
1 Development of scientific  thinking
Students should be able to: Examples of what students could be asked to
do in an exam
WS 1.1 Understand how scientific methods and
theories develop over time.Give examples to show how scientific methods
and theories have changed over time.
Explain, with an example, why new data from
experiments or observations led to changes in
models or theories.
Decide whether or not given data supports a
particular theory.
WS 1.2 Use a variety of models such as
representational, spatial, descriptive,
computational and mathematical to solve
problems, make predictions and to develop
scientific explanations and understanding of
familiar and unfamiliar facts.Recognise/draw/interpret diagrams.
Translate from data to a representation with a
model.
Use models in explanations, or match features
of a model to the data from experiments or
observations that the model describes or
explains.
Make predictions or calculate quantities based
on the model or show its limitations.
Give examples of ways in which a model can
be tested by observation or experiment.AQA GCSE Physics 8463. GCSE exams June 2018 onwards. Version 1.1 30 September 2019
Visit aqa.org.uk/8463  for the most up-to-date specification,  resources, support and administration   11Students should be able to: Examples of what students could be asked to
do in an exam
WS 1.3 Appreciate the power and limitations of
science and consider any ethical issues which
may arise.Explain why data is needed to answer scientific
questions, and why it may be uncertain,
incomplete or not available.
Outline a simple ethical argument about the
rights and wrongs of a new technology.
WS 1.4 Explain everyday and technological
applications of science; evaluate associated
personal, social, economic and environmental
implications; and make decisions based on the

perception of risk in relation to data and
consequences.Give examples to show that there are hazards
associated with science-based technologies
which have to be considered alongside the
benefits.
Suggest reasons why the perception of risk is
often very different from the measured risk (eg
voluntary vs imposed risks, familiar vs
unfamiliar risks, visible vs invisible hazards).
WS 1.6 Recognise the importance of peer
review of results and of communicating results
to a range of audiences.Explain that the process of peer review helps to
detect false claims and to establish a
consensus about which claims should be
regarded as valid.
Explain that reports of scientific developments
in the popular media are not subject to peer
review and may be oversimplified, inaccurate or
biased.

Plot two variables from experimental or other
data.
WS 3.2 Translating data from one form to
another.Translate data between graphical and numeric
form.
WS 3.3 Carrying out and represent
mathematical and statistical analysis.For example:

made, there is always some uncertainty about
the result obtained.
Use the range of a set of measurements about
the mean as a measure of uncertainty.
WS 3.5 Interpreting observations and other
data (presented in verbal, diagrammatic,
graphical, symbolic or numerical form),

do in an exam
WS 3.7 Being objective, evaluating data in
terms of accuracy, precision, repeatability and
reproducibility and identifying potential sources
of random and systematic error.Apply the following ideas to evaluate data to
suggest improvements to procedures and
techniques.
• An accurate measurement is one that is
close to the true value.
• Measurements are precise if they cluster
closely.
• Measurements are repeatable when
repetition, under the same conditions by
the same investigator, gives similar
results.
• Measurements are reproducible if similar
results are obtained by different
investigators with different equipment.
• Measurements are affected by random
error due to results varying in
unpredictable ways; these errors can be
reduced by making more measurements
and reporting a mean value.
• Systematic error is due to measurement
results differing from the true value by a
consistent amount each time.
• Any anomalous values should be
examined to try to identify the cause and,
if a product of a poor measurement,
ignored.
WS 3.8 Communicating the scientific rationale
for investigations, methods used, findings and
reasoned conclusions through paper-based and
electronic reports and presentations using
verbal, diagrammatic, graphical, numerical and
symbolic forms.Present coherent and logically structured
responses, using the ideas in 2 Experimental
skills and strategies and 3 Analysis and

This specification is presented in a two column format. The left hand column contains the
specification content that all students must cover and that can be assessed in the written papers.
The right hand column exemplifies some key opportunities for the following skills to be developed:
WS refers to Working scientifically  (page 11), MS refers to Mathematical requirements  (page 85),
and AT refers to Use of apparatus and techniques  (page 87). These are not the only
opportunities. Teachers are encouraged to introduce all of these skills where appropriate
throughout the course.
Each topic begins with an overview. The overview puts the topic into a broader context and is
intended to encourage an overarching approach to both the teaching and learning of each of the
topic areas. It is not directly assessed. Any assessable content in this overview is replicated in the
left hand column.
Most of the content is co-teachable with GCSE Combined Science: Trilogy. Content that is only
applicable to physics is indicated by (physics only) either next to the topic heading where it applies
to the whole topic or immediately preceding each paragraph or bullet point as applicable. Content
that is only applicable to Higher Tier is indicated by (HT only) either next to the topic heading
where it applies to the whole topic or immediately preceding each paragraph or bullet point as
applicable.
It is good practice to teach and develop all of the mathematical skills throughout the course. Some
mathematical skills will only be assessed in certain subject areas. These are detailed in 
Mathematical requirements  (page 85).
Science is a practical subject. Details of the assessment of required practicals can be found in 
Practical assessment  (page 87).
Working scientifically  (page 11) and Use of apparatus and techniques  (page 87) skills will be
assessed across all papers.
Questions in paper 2 may draw on an understanding of energy changes and transfers due to
heating, mechanical and electrical work and the concept of energy conservation from sections 
Energy  (page 17) and Electricity  (page 23).
4.1 Energy
The concept of energy emerged in the 19th century. The idea was used to explain the work output
of steam engines and then generalised to understand other heat engines. It also became a key tool
for understanding chemical reactions and biological systems.
Limits to the use of fossil fuels and global warming are critical problems for this century. Physicists
and engineers are working hard to identify ways to reduce our energy usage.AQA GCSE Physics 8463. GCSE exams June 2018 onwards. Version 1.1 30 September 2019

before and after such changes
4.1.1.1 Energy stores and systems
Content Key opportunities for
skills development
A system is an object or group of objects.
There are changes in the way energy is stored when a system
changes.
Students should be able to describe all the changes involved in the
way energy is stored when a system changes, for common
situations. For example:
• an object projected upwards
• a moving object hitting an obstacle
• an object accelerated by a constant force
• a vehicle slowing down
• bringing water to a boil in an electric kettle.
Throughout this section on Energy students should be able to
calculate the changes in energy involved when a system is changed
by:
• heating
• work done by forces
• work done when a current flowsThe link between work done
(energy transfer) and
current flow in a circuit is
covered in Energy transfers
(page 29).

Energy can be transferred usefully, stored or dissipated, but cannot
be created or destroyed.
Students should be able to describe with examples where there are
energy transfers in a closed system, that there is no net change to
the total energy.
Students should be able to describe, with examples, how in all
system changes energy is dissipated, so that it is stored in less
useful ways. This energy is often described as being ‘wasted’.AQA GCSE Physics 8463. GCSE exams June 2018 onwards. Version 1.1 30 September 2019

skills development
Students should be able to explain ways of reducing unwanted
energy transfers, for example through lubrication and the use of
thermal insulation.
The higher the thermal conductivity of a material the higher the rate
of energy transfer by conduction across the material.
Students should be able to describe how the rate of cooling of a
building is affected by the thickness and thermal conductivity of its
walls.
Students do not need to know the definition of thermal conductivity.WS 1.4

Investigate thermal
conductivity using rods of
different materials.

Students should be able to explain that, for some resistors, the
value of R remains constant but that in others it can change as the
current changes.
The current through an ohmic conductor (at a constant
temperature) is directly proportional to the potential difference
across the resistor. This means that the resistance remains
constant as the current changes.
The resistance of components such as lamps, diodes, thermistors
and LDRs is not constant; it changes with the current through the
component.
The resistance of a filament lamp increases as the temperature of
the filament increases.

Internal energy is the total kinetic energy and potential energy of all

charged electrons.
The radius of a nucleus is less than 1/10 000 of the radius of an

The electrons are arranged at different distances from the nucleus

Content Key opportunities for
skills development
New experimental evidence may lead to a scientific model being
changed or replaced.
Before the discovery of the electron, atoms were thought to be tiny
spheres that could not be divided.
The discovery of the electron led to the plum pudding model of the
atom. The plum pudding model suggested that the atom is a ball of
positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it.
The results from the alpha particle scattering experiment led to the
conclusion that the mass of an atom was concentrated at the centre
(nucleus) and that the nucleus was charged. This nuclear model
replaced the plum pudding model.
Niels Bohr adapted the nuclear model by suggesting that electrons
orbit the nucleus at specific distances. The theoretical calculations
of Bohr agreed with experimental observations.
Later experiments led to the idea that the positive charge of any
nucleus could be subdivided into a whole number of smaller
particles, each particle having the same amount of positive charge.
The name proton was given to these particles.
The experimental work of James Chadwick provided the evidence
to show the existence of neutrons within the nucleus. This was
about 20 years after the nucleus became an accepted scientific
idea.

4.4.2.1 Radioactive decay and nuclear radiation
Content Key opportunities for
skills development
Some atomic nuclei are unstable. The nucleus gives out radiation
as it changes to become more stable. This is a random process
called radioactive decay.
Activity is the rate at which a source of unstable nuclei decays.
Activity is measured in becquerel (Bq)
Count-rate is the number of decays recorded each second by a
detector (eg Geiger-Muller tube).
The nuclear radiation emitted may be:
• an alpha particle (α) – this consists of two neutrons and two
protons, it is the same as a helium nucleus
• a beta particle (β) – a high speed electron ejected from the
nucleus as a neutron turns into a proton
• a gamma ray (γ) – electromagnetic radiation from the nucleus
• a neutron (n).
Required knowledge of the properties of alpha particles, beta
particles and gamma rays is limited to their penetration through
materials, their range in air and ionising power.
Students should be able to apply their knowledge to the uses of

skills development
Nuclear equations are used to represent radioactive decay.
In a nuclear equation an alpha particle may be represented by the
symbol:
and a beta particle by the symbol:
The emission of the different types of nuclear radiation may cause a
change in the mass and /or the charge of the nucleus. For example:
So alpha decay causes both the mass and charge of the nucleus to
decrease.
So beta decay does not cause the mass of the nucleus to change
but does cause the charge of the nucleus to increase.
Students are not required to recall these two examples.
Students should be able to use the names and symbols of common
nuclei and particles to write balanced equations that show single
alpha (α) and beta (β) decay. This is limited to balancing the atomic
numbers and mass numbers. The identification of daughter
elements from such decays is not required.

Content Key opportunities for
skills development
Nuclear fission is the splitting of a large and unstable nucleus (eg
uranium or plutonium).
Spontaneous fission is rare. Usually, for fission to occur the
unstable nucleus must first absorb a neutron.
The nucleus undergoing fission splits into two smaller nuclei,
roughly equal in size, and emits two or three neutrons plus gamma
rays. Energy is released by the fission reaction.
All of the fission products have kinetic energy.
The neutrons may go on to start a chain reaction.
The chain reaction is controlled in a nuclear reactor to control the
energy released. The explosion caused by a nuclear weapon is
caused by an uncontrolled chain reaction.
Students should be able to draw/interpret diagrams representing
nuclear fission and how a chain reaction may occur.

and normal contact force.
Examples of non-contact forces are gravitational force, electrostatic
force and magnetic force.

Content Key opportunities for
skills development
The atmosphere is a thin layer (relative to the size of the Earth) of
air round the Earth. The atmosphere gets less dense with
increasing altitude.
Air molecules colliding with a surface create atmospheric pressure.
The number of air molecules (and so the weight of air) above a
surface decreases as the height of the surface above ground level
increases. So as height increases there is always less air above a
surface than there is at a lower height. So atmospheric pressure
decreases with an increase in height.

atmospheric pressure

Speed does not involve direction. Speed is a scalar quantity.
The speed of a moving object is rarely constant. When people walk,
run or travel in a car their speed is constantly changing.
The speed at which a person can walk, run or cycle depends on
many factors including: age, terrain, fitness and distance travelled.
Typical values may be taken as:
walking ̴ 1.5 m/s
running ̴ 3 m/s
cycling ̴ 6 m/s.
Students should be able to recall typical values of speed for a
person walking, running and cycling as well as the typical values of
speed for different types of transportation systems.
It is not only moving objects that have varying speed. The speed of
sound and the speed of the wind also vary.
A typical value for the speed of sound in air is 330 m/s.
Students should be able to make measurements of distance and

can be determined by drawing a tangent and measuring the
gradient of the distance–time graph at that time.

4.5.6.2.1 Newton's First Law
Content Key opportunities for
skills development
Newton’s First Law:
If the resultant force acting on an object is zero and:
• the object is stationary, the object remains stationary
• the object is moving, the object continues to move at the
same speed and in the same direction. So the object
continues to move at the same velocity.
So, when a vehicle travels at a steady speed the resistive forces
balance the driving force.
So, the velocity (speed and/or direction) of an object will only
change if a resultant force is acting on the object.
Students should be able to apply Newton’s First Law to explain the
motion of objects moving with a uniform velocity and objects where
the speed and/or direction changes.

Wave behaviour is common in both natural and man-made systems. Waves carry energy from one
place to another and can also carry information. Designing comfortable and safe structures such

most of electromagnetic waves.

Sound waves can travel through solids causing vibrations in the
solid.
Within the ear, sound waves cause the ear drum and other parts to
vibrate which causes the sensation of sound. The conversion of
sound waves to vibrations of solids works over a limited frequency
range. This restricts the limits of human hearing.
Students should be able to:
• describe, with examples, processes which convert wave
disturbances between sound waves and vibrations in solids.
Examples may include the effect of sound waves on the ear
drum
• explain why such processes only work over a limited
frequency range and the relevance of this to human hearing.
Students should know that the range of normal human hearing is
from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
4.6.1.5 Waves for detection and exploration (physics only) (HT only)
Content Key opportunities for
skills development
Students should be able to explain in qualitative terms, how the
differences in velocity, absorption and reflection between different
types of wave in solids and liquids can be used both for detection
and exploration of structures which are hidden from direct
observation.
Ultrasound waves have a frequency higher than the upper limit of
hearing for humans. Ultrasound waves are partially reflected when
they meet a boundary between two different media. The time taken
for the reflections to reach a detector can be used to determine how
far away such a boundary is. This allows ultrasound waves to be
used for both medical and industrial imaging.
Seismic waves are produced by earthquakes. P-waves are
longitudinal, seismic waves. P-waves travel at different speeds
through solids and liquids. S-waves are transverse, seismic waves.
S-waves cannot travel through a liquid. P-waves and S-waves
provide evidence for the structure and size of the Earth’s core.
Echo sounding, using high frequency sound waves is used to
detect objects in deep water and measure water depth.WS 1.4
Students should be aware that the study of seismic waves provided
new evidence that led to discoveries about parts of the Earth which
are not directly observable.WS 1.1

4.6.2.1 Types of electromagnetic waves
Content Key opportunities for
skills development
Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves that transfer energy
from the source of the waves to an absorber.
Electromagnetic waves form a continuous spectrum and all types of
electromagnetic wave travel at the same velocity through a vacuum
(space) or air.
The waves that form the electromagnetic spectrum are grouped in
terms of their wavelength and their frequency. Going from long to
short wavelength (or from low to high frequency) the groups are:
radio, microwave, infrared, visible light (red to violet), ultraviolet, X-
rays and gamma rays.
Our eyes only detect visible light and so detect a limited range of
electromagnetic waves.
Students should be able to give examples that illustrate the transfer
of energy by electromagnetic waves.

Content Key opportunities for

(HT only) Different substances may absorb, transmit, refract or
reflect electromagnetic waves in ways that vary with wavelength.
(HT only) Some effects, for example refraction, are due to the
difference in velocity of the waves in different substances.
Students should be able to construct ray diagrams to illustrate the
refraction of a wave at the boundary between two different media.

4.6.2.3 Properties of electromagnetic waves 2
Content Key opportunities for
skills development
(HT only) Radio waves can be produced by oscillations in electrical
circuits.
(HT only) When radio waves are absorbed they may create an
alternating current with the same frequency as the radio wave itself,
so radio waves can themselves induce oscillations in an electrical
circuit.
Changes in atoms and the nuclei of atoms can result in
electromagnetic waves being generated or absorbed over a wide
frequency range. Gamma rays originate from changes in the
nucleus of an atom.
Ultraviolet waves, X-rays and gamma rays can have hazardous
effects on human body tissue. The effects depend on the type of
radiation and the size of the dose. Radiation dose (in sieverts) is a
measure of the risk of harm resulting from an exposure of the body
to the radiation.WS 1.5
1000 millisieverts (mSv) = 1 sievert (Sv)
Students will not be required to recall the unit of radiation dose.
Students should be able to draw conclusions from given data about
the risks and consequences of exposure to radiation.
Ultraviolet waves can cause skin to age prematurely and increase
the risk of skin cancer. X-rays and gamma rays are ionising
radiation that can cause the mutation of genes and cancer.WS 1.5

Content Key opportunities for
skills development
A lens forms an image by refracting light. In a convex lens, parallel
rays of light are brought to a focus at the principal focus. The
distance from the lens to the principal focus is called the focal
length. Ray diagrams are used to show the formation of images by
convex and concave lenses.
The image produced by a convex lens can be either real or virtual.
The image produced by a concave lens is always virtual.
Students should be able to construct ray diagrams to illustrate the
similarities and differences between convex and concave lenses.
The magnification produced by a lens can be calculated using the
equation:MS 5a, 5c
WS 1.2

Content Key opportunities for
skills development
Each colour within the visible light spectrum has its own narrow
band of wavelength and frequency.
Reflection from a smooth surface in a single direction is called
specular reflection. Reflection from a rough surface causes
scattering: this is called diffuse reflection.
Colour filters work by absorbing certain wavelengths (and colour)
and transmitting other wavelengths (and colour).
The colour of an opaque object is determined by which wavelengths
of light are more strongly reflected. Wavelengths that are not
reflected are absorbed. If all wavelengths are reflected equally the
object appears white. If all wavelengths are absorbed the objects
appears black.
Objects that transmit light are either transparent or translucent.
Students should be able to explain:
• how the colour of an object is related to the differential
absorption, transmission and reflection of different
wavelengths of light by the object
• the effect of viewing objects through filters or the effect on
light of passing through filters
• why an opaque object has a particular colour.

4.6.3.1 Emission and absorption of infrared radiation
Content Key opportunities for

All bodies (objects), no matter what temperature, emit and absorb
infrared radiation. The hotter the body, the more infrared radiation it
radiates in a given time.
A perfect black body is an object that absorbs all of the radiation
incident on it. A black body does not reflect or transmit any
radiation. Since a good absorber is also a good emitter, a perfect
black body would be the best possible emitter.

Students should be able to explain:
• that all bodies (objects) emit radiation
• that the intensity and wavelength distribution of any emission
depends on the temperature of the body.
(HT only) A body at constant temperature is absorbing radiation at
the same rate as it is emitting radiation. The temperature of a body
increases when the body absorbs radiation faster than it emits
radiation.
(HT only) The temperature of the Earth depends on many factors
including: the rates of absorption and emission of radiation,
reflection of radiation into space.
(HT only) Students should be able to explain how the temperature
of a body is related to the balance between incoming radiation
absorbed and radiation emitted, using everyday examples to
illustrate this balance, and the example of the factors which
determine the temperature of the Earth.
(HT only) Students should be able to use information, or draw/
interpret diagrams to show how radiation affects the temperature of
the Earth’s surface and atmosphere.WS 1.2
4.7 Magnetism and electromagnetism
Electromagnetic effects are used in a wide variety of devices. Engineers make use of the fact that
a magnet moving in a coil can produce electric current and also that when current flows around a
magnet it can produce movement. It means that systems that involve control or communications
can take full advantage of this.

Content Key opportunities for
skills development
The poles of a magnet are the places where the magnetic forces
are strongest. When two magnets are brought close together they
exert a force on each other. Two like poles repel each other. Two
unlike poles attract each other. Attraction and repulsion between
two magnetic poles are examples of non-contact force.
A permanent magnet produces its own magnetic field. An induced
magnet is a material that becomes a magnet when it is placed in a
magnetic field. Induced magnetism always causes a force of
attraction. When removed from the magnetic field an induced
magnet loses most/all of its magnetism quickly.
Students should be able to describe:
• the attraction and repulsion between unlike and like poles for
permanent magnets
• the difference between permanent and induced magnets.
4.7.1.2 Magnetic fields
Content Key opportunities for
skills development
The region around a magnet where a force acts on another magnet
or on a magnetic material (iron, steel, cobalt and nickel) is called
the magnetic field.
The force between a magnet and a magnetic material is always one
of attraction.
The strength of the magnetic field depends on the distance from the
magnet. The field is strongest at the poles of the magnet.
The direction of the magnetic field at any point is given by the
direction of the force that would act on another north pole placed at
that point. The direction of a magnetic field line is from the north
(seeking) pole of a magnet to the south(seeking) pole of the
magnet.
A magnetic compass contains a small bar magnet. The Earth has a
magnetic field. The compass needle points in the direction of the
Earth’s magnetic field.
Students should be able to:
• describe how to plot the magnetic field pattern of a magnet
using a compass
• draw the magnetic field pattern of a bar magnet showing how
strength and direction change from one point to another

When a current flows through a conducting wire a magnetic field is
produced around the wire. The strength of the magnetic field
depends on the current through the wire and the distance from the
wire.
Shaping a wire to form a solenoid increases the strength of the
magnetic field created by a current through the wire. The magnetic
field inside a solenoid is strong and uniform.
The magnetic field around a solenoid has a similar shape to that of
a bar magnet. Adding an iron core increases the strength of the
magnetic field of a solenoid. An electromagnet is a solenoid with an
iron core.
Students should be able to:
• describe how the magnetic effect of a current can be

If an electrical conductor moves relative to a magnetic field or if
there is a change in the magnetic field around a conductor, a
potential difference is induced across the ends of the conductor. If
the conductor is part of a complete circuit, a current is induced in
the conductor. This is called the generator effect.

There is an observed increase in the wavelength of light from most
distant galaxies. The further away the galaxies, the faster they are

effect is called red-shift.
The observed red-shift provides evidence that space itself (the
universe) is expanding and supports the Big Bang theory.
The Big Bang theory suggests that the universe began from a very
small region that was extremely hot and dense.

distant galaxies are receding ever faster.

Key ideas in physics include:
• the use of models, as in the particle model of matter or the wave models of light and of sound
• the concept of cause and effect in explaining such links as those between force and
acceleration, or between changes in atomic nuclei and radioactive emissions
• the phenomena of ‘action at a distance’ and the related concept of the field as the key to
analysing electrical, magnetic and gravitational effects
• that differences, for example between pressures or temperatures or electrical potentials, are
the drivers of change
• that proportionality, for example between weight and mass of an object or between force and
extension in a spring, is an important aspect of many models in science
• that physical laws and models are expressed in mathematical form.

This specification is designed to be taken over two years.
This is a linear qualification. In order to achieve the award, students must complete all
assessments at the end of the course and in the same series.
GCSE exams and certification for this specification are available for the first time in May/June 2018
and then every May/June for the life of the specification.
All materials are available in English only.
Our GCSE exams in Physics include questions that allow students to demonstrate:
• their knowledge and understanding of the content developed in one section or topic,
including the associated mathematical and practical skills or
• their ability to apply mathematical and practical skills to areas of content they are not
normally developed in or
• their ability to draw together different areas of knowledge and understanding within one
answer.
A range of question types will be used, including multiple choice, short answer and those that
require extended responses. Extended response questions will be of sufficient length to allow
students to demonstrate their ability to construct and develop a sustained line of reasoning which is
coherent, relevant, substantiated and logically structured. Extended responses may be prose,
extended calculations, or a combination of both, as appropriate to the question.

Stage 3. There is no expectation that teaching of such content should be repeated during the
GCSE course where it has already been covered at an earlier stage.
GCSE study in physics provides the foundations for understanding the material world. Scientific
understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students
should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science.
They should be helped to appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world
can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are both
inter-linked, and are of universal application. These key ideas include:
• the use of models, as in the particle model of matter or the wave models of light and of sound
• the concept of cause and effect in explaining such links as those between force and
acceleration, or between changes in atomic nuclei and radioactive emissions
• the phenomena of ‘action at a distance’ and the related concept of the field as the key to
analysing electrical, magnetic and gravitational effects
• that differences, for example between pressures or temperatures or electrical potentials, are
the drivers of changeAQA GCSE Physics 8463. GCSE exams June 2018 onwards. Version 1.1 30 September 2019

extension in a spring, is an important aspect of many models in science
• that physical laws and models are expressed in mathematical form.
These key ideas are relevant in different ways and with different emphases in biology, chemistry
and physics: examples of their relevance are given below for physics.
GCSE specifications in Physics should enable students to:
• develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding of physics
• develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of physics
• develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry and problem-solving
skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other learning environments
• develop their ability to evaluate claims based on physics through critical analysis of the
methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
Physics should be studied in ways that help students to develop curiosity about the natural world,
insight into how science works, and appreciation of its relevance to their everyday lives. The scope
and nature of such study should be broad, coherent, practical and satisfying, and thereby
encourage students to be inspired, motivated and challenged by the subject and its achievements.
5.2 Assessment objectives
Assessment objectives (AOs) are set by Ofqual and are the same across all GCSE Physics
specifications and all exam boards.
The exams will measure how students have achieved the following assessment objectives.
• AO1: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of: scientific ideas; scientific techniques
and procedures.
• AO2: Apply knowledge and understanding of: scientific ideas; scientific enquiry, techniques
and procedures.
• AO3: Analyse information and ideas to: interpret and evaluate; make judgments and draw
conclusions; develop and improve experimental procedures.

6.1 Entries and codes
You only need to make one entry for each qualification – this will cover all the question papers,
non-exam assessment and certification.
Every specification is given a national discount (classification) code by the Department for
Education (DfE), which indicates its subject area.
If a student takes two specifications with the same discount code:
• further and higher education providers are likely to take the view that they have only
achieved one of the two qualifications
• only one of them will be counted for the purpose of the School and College Performance
tables  – the DfE's rules on 'early entry' will determine which one.
Please check this before your students start their course.

6.5 Previous learning and prerequisites
There are no previous learning requirements. Any requirements for entry to a course based on this
specification are at the discretion of schools and colleges.
6.6 Access to assessment: diversity and inclusion
General qualifications are designed to prepare students for a wide range of occupations and
further study. Therefore our qualifications must assess a wide range of competences.
The subject criteria have been assessed to see if any of the skills or knowledge required present
any possible difficulty to any students, whatever their ethnic background, religion, sex, age,
disability or sexuality. If any difficulties were encountered, the criteria were reviewed again to make
sure that tests of specific competences were only included if they were important to the subject.
As members of the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) we participate in the production of the
JCQ document Access Arrangements and Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational
qualifications . We follow these guidelines when assessing the needs of individual students who
may require an access arrangement or reasonable adjustment. This document is published on the
JCQ website at jcq.org.uk
6.6.1 Students with disabilities and special needs
We can make arrangements for disabled students and students with special needs to help them
access the assessments, as long as the competences being tested are not changed. Access
arrangements must be agreed before  the assessment. For example, a Braille paper would be a
reasonable adjustment for a Braille reader but not for a student who does not read Braille.
We are required by the Equality Act 2010 to make reasonable adjustments to remove or lessen
any disadvantage that affects a disabled student.
If you have students who need access arrangements or reasonable adjustments, you can apply
using the Access arrangements online service at aqa.org.uk/eaqa
6.6.2 Special consideration
We can give special consideration to students who have been disadvantaged at the time of the
assessment through no fault of their own – for example a temporary illness, injury or serious
problem such as the death of a relative. We can only do this after  the assessment.
Your exams officer should apply online for special consideration at aqa.org.uk/eaqa

consideration please see aqa.org.uk/access  or email accessarrangementsqueries@aqa.org.uk
6.7 Working with AQA for the first time
If your school or college has not previously offered any AQA specification, you need to register as
an AQA centre to offer our specifications to your students. Find out how at aqa.org.uk/
becomeacentre
6.8 Private candidates
A private candidate is someone who enters for exams through an AQA-approved school or college
but is not enrolled as a student there.
If you are a private candidate you may be self-taught, home-schooled or have private tuition, with a
tutor or distance learning organisation. You must be based in the UK.
All GCSE science students need to complete practical experiments as part of their learning. A
minimum of ten experiments are required for this physics qualification. This equips students with
essential practical knowledge and experiences, enables them to put theory into practice and helps
them develop skills for higher education.
Private candidates wishing to study GCSE sciences need to find a school or college who will let
them carry out the required practicals. Schools and colleges accepting private candidates must
make provision for them to carry out all of the required practical activities as specified in Practical
assessment  (page 87). This is likely to incur a cost. We recommend you contact your local
schools and colleges to organise this as early as possible.
Students won’t be assessed whilst conducting their practical work, but the written exam will include
questions on it. Therefore, candidates lacking hands on experience will be at an immediate
disadvantage.
If you have any queries as a private candidate, you can:
• speak to the Exams officer at the school or college where you intend to take your exams
• visit our website at aqa.org.uk/exams-administration

Practical work is at the heart of physics, so we have placed it at the heart of this specification.
There are three interconnected, but separate reasons for doing practical work in schools. They are:
1.To support and consolidate scientific concepts (knowledge and understanding).
This is done by applying and developing what is known and understood of abstract ideas and
models. Through practical work we are able to make sense of new information and
observations, and provide insights into the development of scientific thinking.
2.To develop investigative skills. These transferable skills include:
• devising and investigating testable questions
• identifying and controlling variables
• analysing, interpreting and evaluating data.
3.To build and master practical skills such as:
• using specialist equipment to take measurements
• handling and manipulating equipment with confidence and fluency
• recognising hazards and planning how to minimise risk.
By focusing on the reasons for carrying out a particular practical, teachers will help their students
understand the subject better, to develop the skills of a scientist and to master the manipulative
skills required for further study or jobs in STEM subjects.
Questions in the written exams will draw on the knowledge and understanding students have
gained by carrying out the practical activities listed below. These questions will count for at least
15% of the overall marks for the qualification. Many of our questions will also focus on investigative
skills and how well students can apply what they know to practical situations often in novel
contexts.
The practical handbook will help teachers plan purposeful practical work that develops both
practical and investigative skills and encourages the thinking behind the doing so that they can
reach their potential.
Teachers are encouraged to further develop students’ abilities by providing other opportunities for
practical work throughout the course. Opportunities are signposted in the right hand column of the
content section of this specification for further skills development.
Our physics scheme of work will provide ideas and suggestions for good practical activities that are
manageable with large classes.
8.1 Use of apparatus and techniques
All students are expected to have carried out the required practical activities in Required practical
activities  (page 88). These develop skills in the use of the following apparatus and techniques.
The following list includes opportunities for choice and use of appropriate laboratory apparatus for
a variety of experimental problem-solving and/or enquiry-based activities.
Safety is an overriding requirement for all practical work. Schools and colleges are responsible for
ensuring that appropriate safety procedures are followed whenever their students undertake
practical work, and should undertake full risk assessments.AQA GCSE Physics 8463. GCSE exams June 2018 onwards. Version 1.1 30 September 2019
Visit aqa.org.uk/8463  for the most up-to-date specification,  resources, support and administration   87Use and production of appropriate scientific diagrams to set up and record apparatus and
procedures used in practical work is common to all science subjects and should be included
wherever appropriate.
AT 1‒7 are common with combined science. AT 8 is physics only.
Apparatus and techniques
AT 1 Use of appropriate apparatus to make and record a range of measurements accurately,
including length, area, mass, time, volume and temperature. Use of such
measurements to determine densities of solid and liquid objects (links to A-level AT a
and b).
AT 2 Use of appropriate apparatus to measure and observe the effects of forces including
the extension of springs (links to A-level AT a).
AT 3 Use of appropriate apparatus and techniques for measuring motion, including
determination of speed and rate of change of speed (acceleration/deceleration) (links
to A-level AT a, b and d).
AT 4 Making observations of waves in fluids and solids to identify the suitability of apparatus
to measure speed/frequency/wavelength. Making observations of the effects of the
interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter (links to A-level AT i and j).
AT 5 Safe use of appropriate apparatus in a range of contexts to measure energy changes/
transfers and associated values such as work done (links to A-level AT a, b).
AT6 Use of appropriate apparatus to measure current, potential difference (voltage) and
resistance, and to explore the characteristics of a variety of circuit elements (links to A-
level AT f).
AT 7 Use of circuit diagrams to construct and check series and parallel circuits including a
variety of common circuit elements (links to A-level AT g).

8.2 Required practical activities
The following practical activities must be carried out by all students taking GCSE Physics.
Following any revision by the Secretary of State of the apparatus or techniques specified, we will
review and revise the required practical activities as appropriate.
Schools and colleges will be informed of any changes in a timely manner and the amended
specification will be published, highlighting the changes accordingly.
Teachers are encouraged to vary their approach to these practical activities. Some are more
suitable for highly structured approaches that develop key techniques while others allow
opportunities for students to develop investigative approaches.
This list is not designed to limit the practical activities carried out by students. A rich practical
experience will include more than the ten required practical activities. The explicit teaching of
practical skills will build students’ competence. Many teachers will also use practical approaches to
introduce content knowledge in the course of their normal teaching.
88   Visit aqa.org.uk/8463  for the most up-to-date specification,  resources, support and administrationSchools and colleges are required to provide a practical science statement to AQA, that is a true
and accurate written statement, which confirms that it has taken reasonable steps to secure that
each student has:
• completed the required practical activities detailed in this specification
• made a contemporaneous record of such work undertaken during the activities and the
knowledge, skills and understanding derived from those activities.
We will provide a form for the head of centre to sign. You must submit the form to us by the date
published at aqa.org.uk/science . We will contact schools and colleges directly with the deadline
date and timely reminders if the form is not received. Failure to send this form counts as
malpractice/maladministration, and may result in formal action or warning for the school or college.
